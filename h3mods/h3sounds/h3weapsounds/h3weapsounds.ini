Name=Halo 3 Weapon Sounds
Author=Kamakazie Pidgeon
Desc=Changes the default weapon's fire sounds to the sounds from Halo 3. Special thanks to Beatthezombie for his work on porting sounds. (This mod may help the soundlag a tad as the default weapons don't have 6 sounds playing when fired, who knows) Only changes the frag/plasma grenade, mauler, assault rifle, beam rifle, carbine, magnum, battle rifle, and smg sounds. This mod does not effect the variant weapons.
